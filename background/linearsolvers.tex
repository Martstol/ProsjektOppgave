\section*{Linear Solvers}

A system of linear equations with $N$ unknowns can be written as 

$Ax = b$

where $A$ is a $N \times N$ matrix, and $x$ and $b$ are column vectors with $N$ 
elements each. We want to solve the system and find an expression for $x$ by calculating
$\inv{A}$. The solution is written as 

$x = \inv{A}b$

\subsection*{Direct Methods}

It would probably be a good idea to describe direct methods for solving linear equations to contrast with the iterative methods. \\
Briefly outline Gauss-Jordan elimination and LU-factorization.
