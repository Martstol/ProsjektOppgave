\section{PETSc}

PETSc is short for Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation 
\cite{petsc-web-page}. It contains various data structures and functions for 
solving partial differential equations in parallel. PETSc supports distributed 
memory systems with MPI, shared memory systems using Pthreads or OpenMP as well 
as GPGPU computing using CUDA or OpenCL.

Despite being written in C, PETSc features an object-oriented design pattern.
There are object types for representing both data structures and solvers.
Instead of accessing data directly, all manipulation of structs uses functions
that abstracts away the underlying implementation. There is no direct data
access, everything goes through functions. This abstracts away complications as 
vectors being distributed to several machines running in parallel.
