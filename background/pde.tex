\section*{Partial Differential Equations}

A Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is a differential equation with multiple 
unknown variables and their partial derivatives. PDEs can be used to model physical 
processes in multiple dimensions.

I'm not sure if I should include this chapter

\subsection*{Poisson Equation}

In general, the Poisson Equation is defined as 

$$\Delta \varphi = f$$

where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator and $\varphi$ and $f$ are real or complex 
functions. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the Poisson Equation can 
be written as 

$$(\pTwo{x} + \pTwo{y} + \pTwo{z}) \varphi (x, y, z) = f(x, y, z)$$

\subsection*{Boundary Value Problem}

Describe what a boundary value problem is, and what types there are.
