This chapter will cover the mathematical background material for my problem. The
first section will briefly cover partial differential equations, boundary value
problems and computational fluid dynamics, then go into further details about
the Poisson equation.

The second section covers the finite difference method for creating systems of
linear equations approximating partial differential equations and will go into
details about the central difference and the discretized Poisson equation.

The third section covers the topic of linear solvers, explaining both direct
methods and iterative methods. This section goes into details about two direct
methods for solving systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination and LU
decomposition and three iterative methods, the Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel and
successive over-relaxation.

The fourth and final section will cover the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for
Scientific Computation, PETSc, which was used in the implementation.
