This chapter will cover the mathematical background material for the project. 
The first section of this chapter covers computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
for the wind simulation as air can be modeled approximately as a fluid with 
zero viscosity and a density equal to one\cite{originalSnowThesis}.

The second section will cover partial differential equations and boundary value
problems. This section will describe the Poisson equation which is solved as a 
part of the wind simulation.

The third section covers the finite difference method for creating systems of
linear equations approximating partial differential equations and will discuss
the central difference and the discretized Poisson equation.

The fourth section covers the topic of linear solvers, explaining both direct
methods and iterative methods. This section describes two direct
methods for solving systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination and LU
decomposition and three iterative methods, the Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel and
successive overrelaxation.

The fifth and final section will cover the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for
Scientific Computation, PETSc, a C library that was used in the implementation.
