\section{Computational Fluid Dynamics}

Fluid flows can be described by partial differential equations for the conservation 
of mass, momentum and energy. 

\subsection{Navier-Stokes Equations}

Navier-Strokes Equations is a set of partial differential equations which can be
used to describe incompressible flows\cite{fluidDynamicsIntro}. 

Momentum equation: 
$$\pOne{t}u  = -(u \cdot \nabla)u - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 u + f$$

Continuity equation:
$$\nabla u = 0$$

In the fluid models for air, some of these terms are left out. If we assume that 
the air has zero viscosity and that the density is equal to one, then the 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reduce to the incompressible Euler 
equations. 

Momentum equation: 
$$\pOne{t}u  = -(u \cdot \nabla)u - \nabla p$$

Continuity equation:
$$\nabla u = 0$$
