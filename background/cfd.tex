\section{Computational Fluid Dynamics}

Fluid flows can be described by partial differential equations for the conservation 
of mass, momentum and energy. 

\subsection{Navier-Stokes Equations}

Navier-Strokes Equations is a set of partial differential equations which can be
used to describe incompressible flows\cite{fluidDynamicsIntro}.
