\section*{Problem Description}

This project will port the wind simulator for the HPC-lab's snow simulator to 
PETSc. PETSc implements a large number of linear system solvers which will make 
it easy to experiment with the choice of solver which gives the best results and 
performance. PETSc also supports parallelization for shared memory systems, 
distributed memory systems and recently GPU systems enabling easy experimentation 
with the choice of parallelization platform.
