\chapter{Conclusion}

In this project PETSc has been used to implement a wind simulator for the HPC-lab's
snow simulator. This was done to investigate the performance gain obtainable by
using high level libraries to use the GPU for computationally intensive problems
instead of hand implementing solvers with low level APIs like CUDA and OpenCL.
A PETSc implementation also enables easy experimentation with parallelization
method as PETSc supports shared memory parallelization, distributed memory
parallelization and GPGPU. In addition PETSc implements a large number of solvers
making it easy to experiment with the choice of solver for the wind simulator.
