\chapter{Wind Simulation}
\label{chap:windsim}

This chapter will derive the full expressions for the mathematical formulas 
used in the implementation of the wind simulation. The wind simulation is 
based on computational fluid dynamics and uses the incompressible Euler 
equation. Finite difference approximations are used to create numerical 
expressions which are suitable for a computer implementation. The snow simulator 
works in a three dimensional Euclidean space, the expressions are therefore also 
written out in their three dimensional form.
