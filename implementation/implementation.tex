\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter will look at the implementation of the wind simulation with PETSc. 
It will first describe how the wind simulation has been implemented in $C++$. Then 
this chapter will describe how a small, modern $C++$ wrapper for PETSc was created.
Finally this chapter details how PETSc was used to setup and solve the discrete 
Poisson problem for the wind simulation.
