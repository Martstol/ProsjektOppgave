\section{Outline}

Chapter \ref{chap:background} details the theoretical foundation material required for the wind
simulation. The chapter looks at the computational fluid dynamics model that is
used to simulate the wind and the assumptions made for the implementation. This
chapter also looks at the finite difference method, the topic of linear solvers
and PETSc will be introduced. Chapter \ref{chap:prevwork} introduces the current version of the
HPC-lab's snow simulator. The history of the snow simulator is covered and the
structure of the code base is briefly outlined. Chapter \ref{chap:windsim} derives the
discretized mathematical expressions that have been implemented in the snow
simulator. Chapter \ref{chap:impl} covers the details of the implementations that have been
done for this project. Chapter \ref{chap:results} presents the results of the implemented wind
simulation and chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} presents the conclusions.
