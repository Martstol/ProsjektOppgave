\section{Outline}

Chapter 2 covers the theoretical foundation material required for the wind
simulation. The chapter looks at the computational fluid dynamics model that is
used to simulate the wind and the assumptions made for the implementation. This
chapter also covers the finite difference method and the topic of linear
solvers. Chapter 3 introduces the current version of the HPC-lab's snow
simulator. The history of the snow simulator is covered and the structure of the
code base is briefly outlined. Chapter 4 derives the discretized mathematical
expressions that have been implemented in the snow simulator. Chapter 5 covers
the details of the implementations that have been done for this project. Chapter
6 presents the results of the implemented wind simulation. Chapter 7 discusses
the results and chapter 8 presents the conclusions. Finally in chapter 9
possible future work to improve the implementation is presented.
