\section{Problem Description}

This project will implement a wind simulator for the HPC-lab's snow simulator 
using the PETSc library. PETSc was previously implemented in the CPU version
of the snow simulator by Mads Buvik Sandvei for his specialization project.
This project will use PETSc in the GPU version of the snow simulator
and create a wind simulation implementation using PETSc's GPU solvers.

The performace of PETSc's GPU solvers will be compared with the performace
of PETSc's CPU implementations of these solvers and the solvers previously
implemented in the snow simulator.
