\section{Problem Description}

This project will implement a wind simulator in the HPC-lab's snow simulator 
using the PETSc library. PETSc was previously implemented in the CPU version
of the snow simulator by Mads Buvik Sandvei for his specialization project.
This project will implementing PETSc in the GPU version of the snow simulator
and utilize PETSc's GPU solvers in the wind simulation.
