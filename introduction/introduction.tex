\chapter{Introduction}

This project will continue work on the HPC-lab's snow simulator by writing an
implementation of the wind simulator with the library
PETSc\footnote{\url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/}} and comparing the
performance of the PETSc implementation with the previously implemented wind
simulator. The snow simulator simulates falling snow particles and how they are
affected by the wind and terrain. Realistic modeling of how the wind is affected
by terrain is a challenging topic and an important part of simulating natural
phenomenons like the weather. The snow simulator uses computational fluid
dynamics to model the behavior of the wind and how it is affected by the
terrain. In computational fluid dynamics the behavior of a fluid is modeled by a
set of partial differential equations which can be solved to get the fluid's
velocity.
