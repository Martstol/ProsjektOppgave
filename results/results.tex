\chapter{Results}

This chapter contains the test results for the PETSc implementation of the wind
simulation. The first part will describe the hardware used in the workstation
and the software used when benchmarking the performance the
wind simulator. It will also describe what flags were set when configuring PETSc.
The second part will look at benchmarks measuring the performance of the
wind simulator, comparing the performance when using different solvers for the
simulation.
