\chapter{Results}

This chapter contains the test results for the PETSc implementation of the wind
simulation. The first part will describe the hardware used in the workstation
and the software used when benchmarking the performance and convergence of the
wind simulator.It will also describe how PETSc was configured and what settins
were used. 
The second part will look at the test results for the accuracy of the solver
with a convergence test and a performance test.
