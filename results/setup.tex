\section{Setup}

This section will describe the compilation of PETSc and the snow simulator as well 
as the hardware and software of the workstation used for the tests in the next section. 

\subsection{PETSc}

PETSc was acquired from the PETSc Web Page\cite{petsc-web-page} as version 3.5.2. 
The version of the compilers used when configuring PETSc can be found in table 
\ref{table:workstation}.

\subsubsection{Development configuration}

For development, PETSc was configured with the following flags:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=0 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
\end{lstlisting}
Debugging is by default enabled by the PETSc configuration, therefore the debug 
flag is not being specified.

\subsubsection{Testing configuration}

To use PETSc's GPU features, it is recommended to use the current development 
version of PETSc. Therefore PETSc was obtained from PETSc's bitbucket repository
\footnote{https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc}. Petsc was then configured as follows:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=0
--with-debugging=0 --with-precision=single
COPTFLAGS='-O3' CXXOPTFLAGS='-O3' 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
--with-cuda=1 --with-cuda-dir=/usr/local/cuda-6.5 
--with-cuda-arch=sm_52 --with-cusp=1 --download-cusp=yes
\end{lstlisting}
For this configuration of PETSc debugging was disabled and precision was set to 
single. This is because single precision is faster and some GPUs may not support 
double precision. The rest of the snow simulator also uses single precision.

The CUDA installation is located in the folder \emph{/usr/local/cuda-6.5}

\subsection{Compilation}

\subsection{Workstation}

This project was only tested on one workstation. Table \ref{table:workstation} contains 
the specifications for the workstation used.
