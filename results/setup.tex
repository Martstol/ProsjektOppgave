\section{Setup}

This section will describe the compilation of PETSc and the snow simulator as well 
as the hardware and software of the workstation used for the tests in the next section. 

\subsection{PETSc}

PETSc was obtained from 

For development, PETSc was configured with the following flags:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=0 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
\end{lstlisting}
Debug options are by default enabled, therefore the debug flag is not being specified.

For performance tests, a PETSc configured with these flags were used:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran 
--with-debugging=0 --with-precision=single
COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
CXXOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
FOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Compilation}

\subsection{Workstation}

This project was only tested on one workstation. Table \ref{tab:workstation} contains 
the specifications for the workstation used.
