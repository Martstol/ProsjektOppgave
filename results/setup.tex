\section{Setup}

This section will describe the compilation of PETSc and the snow simulator as well 
as the hardware and software of the workstation used for the tests in the next section. 

\subsection{PETSc}

PETSc was acquired from the PETSc Web Page\cite{petsc-web-page}. 

For development, PETSc was configured with the following flags:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=0 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
\end{lstlisting}
Debugging is by default enabled by the PETSc configuration, therefore the debug 
flag is not being specified.

For performance tests, a PETSc configured with these flags were used:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran 
--with-debugging=0 --with-precision=single
COPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
CXXOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
FOPTFLAGS='-O3 -march=native -mtune=native' 
--download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Compilation}

\subsection{Workstation}

This project was only tested on one workstation. Table \ref{table:workstation} contains 
the specifications for the workstation used.
