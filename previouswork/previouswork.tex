\chapter{Previous Work}
\label{chap:prevwork}

This chapter will cover previous work related to the project. The previous work for 
this project is the HPC-lab's snow simulator. This chapter will give an overview 
of the snow simulator and then go further into detail about the wind field simulator, 
which is closest related to my project.
