\section{Snow Simulator}

The snow simulator has been developed over several years by different students in 
the HPC-lab at NTNU. It simulates a finite number of snow particles and how they 
are affected by the wind and terrain. The following master theses and specialization 
projects have worked on the snow simulator:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Avalanche Simulations using Fracture Mechanics on the GPU\cite{avalancheThesis}
\end{itemize}
