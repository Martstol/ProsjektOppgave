\section*{Partial Differential Equations}

Outline what PDEs are

\subsection*{Poisson Equation}

Describe the Poisson Equation, applicability, mention wind?

\section*{Finite Difference Method}

Describe how the Finite Difference Method creates a linear system for a PDE. \\
Example with the Poisson Equation.

\section*{Linear Solvers}

Introduce the topic of Linear Solvers.

\subsection*{Direct Methods}

It would probably be a good idea to describe direct methods for solving linear equations to contrast with the iterative methods. \\
Briefly outline Gauss-Jordan elimination and LU-factorization. 

\subsection*{Iterative Methods}

Describe iterative methods

\subsubsection*{Jacobi Method}

Describe the Jacobi method

\subsubsection*{Gauss-Seidel Method}

Describe Gauss-Seidel method

\subsubsection*{Successive Over-relaxation}

Describe successive over-relaxation

\section*{Petsc}

Describe petsc.

\subsection*{BLAS and LAPACK}

Describe BLAS and LAPACK.

\subsection*{MPI}

Describe MPI. (Mentiod MIMD, SIMD etc?)

\section*{GPU}

Petsc also features GPU support. That I might look into if I have the time. In which case I should write a section on gpgpu programming and related matters.\\
